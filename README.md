# Bloom Layout
### Reusable presentational components in React

## What & Why
This library provides fully-accessible, reusable components with easily-overridable default styles. They don't depend on Redux or other stateful libraries to function, but implementation suggestions are discussed.

Accessibility of data-heavy and data-interruptive (like Alerts and Modals) components can be complex to write. These components abstract out considerations for screen readers, tab order, etc. while allowing a variety of different contents inside of them that don't need to be concerned for these issues.
